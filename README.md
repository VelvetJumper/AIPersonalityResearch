Over the course of a semester (08/2022 - 12/2022) research into the importance of AI personality preference by user was conducted.

Catherine Baker completed research on emoji interpretation and use by extroverts and introverts through survey and literature review. This data culminated in a conclusion that extroverts tend to use emojis that convey a lesser intensity of emotions than introverts. Furthermore, we also concluded that introverts tend to use emojis that convey a greater intensity of emotions than extroverts. This research was combined with research by Tom Gu on chatbots.

Tom Gu completed research on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Big Five (also known as OCEAN) Personality Test (BFPT). This data resulted in phrases and attributes that were found to be associated with different personality traits in humans. Tom then combined his data with the emoji research and created 16 chatbots, each with a Myers-Briggs-defined personality type based on the MBTI and the BFPT.

Each student completed an individual research paper on their own research and topic (EmojiInterpretation.pdf is included while Tom Gu's paper is not). These chatbots then were then used to conduct an experiment in which, college-age students communicated with each chatbot and reported their views of the chatbot's personality and their conversation. The personality type of the participants was taken into account in their reports. Following this data collection, analysis and data interpretation was conducted and reported in a third research paper titled UserPreferenceinAI.pdf.
